## 📈 Machine Learning Model

The system applies Machine Learning algorithms to predict employee churn based on historical employee records.

### Libraries Used

- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib

### Model Objective

Predict whether an employee is likely to:

- Stay in the organization
- Leave the organization

The prediction helps HR managers identify high-risk employees and take proactive retention measures.

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Launch the frontend and backend services.
2. Enter employee details through the web interface.
3. Submit the form for prediction.
4. View employee churn probability and prediction results.
5. Analyze employee insights using the dashboard.
